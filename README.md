# Crime-Communities-Regression-Modeling-in-R

This is one part of a final project submitted for the STAT 154 "Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning" class I completed at UC Berkeley.

The crime and communities dataset contains crime data from communities in the United States. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.

Our tasks are to explore the data and then fit a model of our choosing to the features in order to predict the frequency of violent crimes per person.

The tasks are listed below -

#### Dataset exploration

In this section, you should provide a thorough exploration of the features of the dataset. Things to keep in mind in this section include:

•Which variables are categorical versus numerical?

•What are the general summary statistics of the data? How can these be visualized?

•Is the data normalized? Should it be normalized?

•Are there missing values in the data? How should these missing values be handled?

•Can the data be well-represented in fewer dimensions?

#### Regression

Predict the ViolentCrimesPerPop using a regression model.
